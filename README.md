# Simple Tic Tac Toe App

This is a simple tic tac toe app that I created with Angular 7.
Below I have included a simple mock that I created in balsamiq of what I am going for. 

Each time the next player's turn is up, their side of the board will change to <span style="color:green">green.</span>  Once they select the position on the board they want to choose, the turn will move to the other player untill the game is won or tied.
